<info>
<p>Survival analysis, also called event history analysis in social science,
or reliability analysis in engineering, deals with time until occurrence
of an event of interest. However, this failure time may not be observed
within the relevant time period, producing so-called censored observations. 
</p>
<p>This task view aims at presenting the useful R packages for the analysis
of time to event data.</p>
